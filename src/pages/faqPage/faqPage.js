        Sizing varies among our styles, but all of our shoes are medium width and most are full sizes only. Please note that we now do include half sizes in our Tree Breezers and Tree Dashers!
        
        The Wool collection starts out a little snug and then stretches naturally, while the Tree material is super accommodating, but will fit similarly over time as it retains shape.
        
        We've found most full-size customers stick with their full size in both materials.
        
        If you're a half size, we've found most customers size up in every silhouette beside the Tree Runners. If you have a wider foot and you're a half size, we'd suggest sizing up to the next full size in everything!"

            accordionBtnTitle="Will my shoes stretch?"
            accordionBTnBody="Will my shoes stretch?Great question! If your Wool shoes are a bit snug to start, you can expect them to stretch about a quarter inch after a few weeks of wear. In contrast, your Tree shoes will likely retain their original shape. Either way, we recommend wearing them for 1-2 weeks to break in. Pro tip: trying them with socks can also help the shoes break in more easily!  

        Please feel free to give them a try in the wild during your extended trial period until January 15th, no-questions-asked!"

            accordionBTnBody="Do The Golden Shoe have good arch support?
        Our padded insole is made from a castor bean oil blend with a wool lining topper. This cushioned insert has very noticeable arch support compared to minimalist shoes :)
        
        If you are seeking a simply designed casual shoe with arch support, we hope you'll give these a shot!
        
        For customers looking to use their own inserts or orthotics, our insole is easily removable to make these adjustments. In addition, the wool upper will stretch and may accommodate an orthotic on top of our wool insole. However, some customers have noticed that they do not need to use their orthotics given the level of cushion, so it's worth a try!"
